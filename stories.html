                    <h3>Helen Keller: Triumph Over Adversity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Helen Keller was born in 1880 in Alabama, USA. At 19 months old, she suffered an illness that left her deaf, blind, and unable to speak. Despite these challenges, Helen's parents sought help and found Anne Sullivan, a dedicated teacher who herself had impaired vision.

                        Anne Sullivan arrived when Helen was seven. Their early days were filled with frustration, but a breakthrough came when Helen connected the sensation of water running over her hand with the word "water" spelled into her palm. This moment sparked Helen's desire to learn and communicate.

                        Helen became the first person with her disabilities to earn a Bachelor’s degree. She learned to speak, read Braille, and communicate through sign language. Throughout her life, Helen gave speeches and lectures, inspiring audiences with her determination and joy for life.

                        She advocated for people with disabilities, women’s suffrage, and birth control. Helen co-founded <strong>Helen Keller International</strong>, an organization devoted to research in vision, health, and nutrition. Her life story was immortalized in the film <em>The Miracle Worker</em>.

                        Helen Keller wrote 12 books and numerous articles, leaving a legacy of courage, service, and advocacy. She passed away at the age of 87 in 1968, remembered as a symbol of hope and possibility.
